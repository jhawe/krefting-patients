All patient sheets have to be deposited directly under data/ as *.xlsx files.
First, for each of the files the individual sheets are extracted and saved
under results/patient_data/{excel_name}/{*sheet_names*}.
Then, an RMarkdown is rendered which summarizes all data into a single table
and creates some basic exploratory plots. The merged table is saved under
results/merged.tsv.

Below code shows how to perform the two above mentioned steps from the analysis:
```{bash}
./scripts/convert.sh
R -e "rmarkdown::render('report.Rmd',output_file='report.html')"
```
